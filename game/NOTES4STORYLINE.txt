[About]

Libitina(My version of the character):
At a young age Libitina was experimented to become the ultimate weapon but ended up as a failed
experiment she was discarded into a orphanage. At the age of 7 she became very sick due to all the experiments
not only her mind was deteriorating she overheard her doctors telling her care takers that she wouldn't live past high school.
knowing this she tries to keep her distants from everyone as she remained in the hospital until the end of her middle school.
her care takers decided to send her to high school. Being the "new transfer student"she spends her time alone doing homework and read her
favorite graphic novel until she bumped into Rai where she began to have these "feelings" something that she haven't felt before.
wanting to always to have these feeling shes trys to get closer with rai until Rai introduce her to his childhood friend Sayori and Sayori inviting
her to the club.Wanting to make sure no other girls get close to Rai she agrees to join the club not knowing the world as she know it is About
to end.

she has Psychokinesis due to the experiment, her "third eye suppression" can also stop time a bit but this takes a toll on her body so she doesn't use her "powers" that often
until she killed the Monika from her world where now she has the same abilities as Monika due to the "epiphany" now the more monika(or someone with the "epiphany") she kills
the stronger she becomes.
